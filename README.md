# Wine Quality Prediction Model

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and related files for a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this model is the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data on various properties of wines, such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol content, 
along with a quality rating.

## Model

The prediction model is built using a Random Forest algorithm, chosen for its ability to handle a large number of features and its robustness against overfitting.

## Files

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset.
- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the model.
- `model/`: This directory contains the trained model.

## Usage

To use this model, run the script `predict.py` with a .csv file containing the wine properties as an argument. The script will output the predicted quality rating.
